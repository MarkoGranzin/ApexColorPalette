# ApexColorPalette
Simply put the item  on the apex page and the colors of the material design can be selected. 

For your own color palettes you can configure a Color Json.
There are  2 mode:
1) the two click mode in which you first choose the color and then the brightness separately
 2) the one click mode where you can directly select what you want to see.
